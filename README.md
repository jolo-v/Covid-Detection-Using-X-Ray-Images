# Covid-Detection-Using-X-Ray-Images
Image recognition model that detects presence of covid based on x-ray images.

After installing the requirements or confirming that these are already installed, the data must be dwnloaded. Due to its large size and limitations on Github storage, 
images could be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset?select=Coronahack-Chest-XRay-Dataset. The required metadata,
however, is already made available in this repository.

The code could then be run. Running the model training code will result in the creation of a tensorflow model object saved in a folder called "Image_Recog". This new folder must be in the same directory as the deployment code.
